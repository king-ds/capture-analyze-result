    <string name="beausline">
        \t\tBeaus lines are indentations that run across the nails. The indentations can appear when growth at the area under the cuticle is interrupted by injury or severe illness.\n
        \n\t\tConditions associated with Beaus lines include uncontrolled diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, as well as illnesses associated with a high fever, such as scarlet fever, measles, mumps and pneumonia. Beaus lines can also be a sign of zinc deficiency.\n

    <string name="clubbed_nail">
        \t\tNail clubbing occurs when the tips of the fingers enlarge and the nails curve around the fingertips, usually over the course of years.\n
        \n\t\tNail clubbing is sometimes the result of low oxygen in the blood and could be a sign of various types of lung disease. Nail clubbing is also associated with inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, liver disease and AIDS.\n
    </string>

    <string name="spoon_nail">
        \t\tSpoon-shaped or spooning fingernails refers to a concavity in the fingernail itself, resulting in a depression in the nail that gives an appearance of a spoon shape to the entire nail. This growth disturbance in the nail is medically known as koilonychia. The spooning is typically such that a water droplet may be placed and held in the depression within the nail.\n
        \n\t\tThis pattern can sometimes be seen in normal infants, but it disappears as the child ages. Koilonychia is a component of the nail-patella syndrome, a genetic disease characterized by numerous abnormalities including musculoskeletal and kidney abnormalities.Spooning fingernails can also result from trauma, exposure to certain solvents, or it may be associated with chronic medical conditions. In particular, koilonychias is associated with iron deficiency.\n

    <string name="terry_nail">
        \t\tWith the condition known as Terrys nails, most of the nails appear white except for a narrow pink band at the tip.\n
        \n\t\tTerrys nails can sometimes be attributed to aging. In other cases, Terrys nails can be a sign of a serious underlying condition, such as liver disease, congestive heart failure, kidney failure or diabetes.\n

    <string name="yello_nail">
        \t\tWith yellow nail syndrome, nails thicken and new growth slows. This results in a yellowish discoloration of the nails.\n
        \n\t\tNails affected by yellow nail syndrome might lack a cuticle and detach from the nail bed in places. Yellow nail syndrome is often a sign of respiratory disease, such as chronic bronchitis. Yellow nail syndrome can also be related to swelling of the hands (lymphedema).\n
